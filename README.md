## Preface ##

This is a list of useful resources for software development and programming in general. These resources are targetted at the most common questions and topics in the `#coding-cave` channel. I've also added resources that I think are the are most commonly used in the industry and/or are useful for development in the software industry. I've tried to keep the list concise and precise for beginners to intermediate programmers. For more resources on even more advanced topics, checkout [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

I hope you find something useful that helps you in developing your career or finishing your personal projects!

Also, if your havent checked out the [pinned Notion page](https://hapebeast.notion.site/hapebeast/HAPEBEAST-coding-cave-28adceeed4c64dac85ccdb36216f81f9) yet, please do. It has very helpful and beginner friendly guides on various topics written by other HAPES.
