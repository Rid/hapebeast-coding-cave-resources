## Preface ##

This is a list of useful resources for software development and programming in general. These resources are targetted at the most common questions and topics in the `#coding-cave` channel. I've also added resources that I think are the are most commonly used in the industry and/or are useful for development in the software industry. I've tried to keep the list concise and precise for less experienced programmers. For more resources on even more advanced topics, checkout [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

I hope you find something useful that helps you in developing your career or finishing your personal projects!

Also, if your havent checked out the [pinned Notion page](https://hapebeast.notion.site/hapebeast/HAPEBEAST-coding-cave-28adceeed4c64dac85ccdb36216f81f9) yet, please do. It has very helpful and beginner friendly guides on various topics written by other HAPES.
