## Preface ##

This is a list of useful resources for software development and programming in general. These resources are targetted at the most common questions and topics in the `#coding-cave` channel. I've also added resources that I think are the are most commonly used in the industry and/or are useful for development in the software industry.

I hope you find something useful that helps you in developing your career or finishing your personal projects!

If you would like to add to this list, check out `CONTRIBUTING.md` or ping me on discord (`#! donutboy | HAPEBEAST`). HAPES TOGETHER STRONG!

Also, if your havent checked out the [pinned Notion page](https://hapebeast.notion.site/hapebeast/HAPEBEAST-coding-cave-28adceeed4c64dac85ccdb36216f81f9) yet, please do. It has very helpful and beginner friendly guides on various topics written by other HAPES.

## Git ##

```text
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
```

I'm putting this at the top because it's one of the most useful skills you should have. If you are collaborating with other programmers, even if you're just starting out, I can almost guarantee you will use git at some point.
