## Preface ##

This is a list of useful resources for software development and programming in general. These resources are targetted at the most common questions and topics in the `#coding-cave` channel. I've also added resources that I think are the are most commonly used in the industry and/or are useful for development in the software industry.

I hope you find something useful that helps you in developing your career or finishing your personal projects!
